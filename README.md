# Angular

### What is Directive?

     -> There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
          01. Components directives
          02. Structural directives
               -> Structural Directives change the structure of the view. Two examples are NgFor and NgIf.
          03. Attribute directives
               -> Attribute directives are used as attributes of elements. NgClass, NgStyle, NgModel are Attribute directives.
