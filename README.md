# Angular

### What is Components!
     -> Component decorator allows you to mark a class as an Angular component and provide additional
     metadata that determines how the component should be processed, instantiated and used at runtime.
     -> Angular components are a subset of directives.
     -> A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application.

### What is Directive!
     -> There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
          01. Components directives
          02. Structural directives
               -> Structural Directives change the structure of the view. Two examples are NgFor and NgIf.
          03. Attribute directives
               -> Attribute directives are used as attributes of elements. NgClass, NgStyle, NgModel
               are Attribute directives.
### What is Pipes!
     -> Pipes transform displayed values within a template.
     -> Angular comes with some Built  in pipes. Such as: DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe,
     CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe.

### What is Router!
     -> Router enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks.
